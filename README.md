POS TAGGING - IRISH LANGUAGE

In order to find out the POS Tagging in the Irish Language, we have used the Viterbi Algorithm to predict it from scratch. 

For anything goes, we have implemented it using deep learning sequential models and decision trees. 

For references, we have taken up pieces of code and concept from the following links:
